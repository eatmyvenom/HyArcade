# Rounds
In the api some things are called rounds, however these are not labeled consistently or even in any way thats easy to work with. Within my site I am keeping the names as rounds since thats what the stats are officially called. However here I will label what they are thought to be.

### Hole in the wall
The rounds in hole in the wall have been tested to be perfect walls completed.

### Hypixel says
The rounds are apparently stars in hypixel says, I have not tested this or anything but thats what I have been told.
