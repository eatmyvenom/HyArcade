## Tech Stack
* **NodeJS** - I started writing this in JS and didn't stop
* **yarn** - Used over npm for workspaces
* **MongoDB** - Best node compatable database system
* **DiscordJS** - module that allows you to easily interact with the Discord API.
* **node-canvas** - A near identical copy to html5 canvas for nodejs

## How to Run
**NodeJS 16+ is needed**
### Step 1 - Get the code
```
git clone https://github.com/eatmyvenom/hyarcade
cd hyarcade
```

### Step 2 - Install dependencies ***
```
yarn install
```

### Step 3 - Configure
In the `types/config/` directory there is a schema for each config file i have in the `config/` directory.

If you do not want to use this then make sure to set the following environment variables.
```bash
# Get this from "/api new" on the hypixel server
HYARCADE_HYPIXEL_KEY

# A password for the sensitive parts of the api
HYARCADE_KEY

# A token to run the discord bot
HYARCADE_DISCORD_TOKEN

# A channel snowflake for logging
HYARCADE_LOG_CHANNEL

# A webhook url
HYARCADE_WEBHOOKV2

# A JSON representation of a webhook
HYARCADE_WEBHOOK
```

### Step 4 - Run the API
This step depends on a mongo server running on the same system
```bash
yarn api
```

### Step 5 - Run the Bot
```bash
yarn bot
```

### Step 6 - Host website
*The website is all really the only not self contained part of this.*

To run the website u need to have some other web service hosting a directory on your system. After that all the pages need to be symlinked into that directory. Then all the game pages need to be symlinked by abbreviated name.
